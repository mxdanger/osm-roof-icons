# osm-roof-icons

Rendered in Blender with the [Object Sequence](https://github.com/sacrish/Object-Sequence) add-on. Made for the [roof:shape=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:roof:shape) page on the OpenStreetMap Wiki.

For standardization purposes all of the roofs I rendered are 2 by 2 meter base with `height=2` and `roof:height=1` and all aligned with the same `roof:orientation=*` if applicable. `roof:shape=flat` is an exception with only `height=1`. The roof shapes themselves are my interpretation; however, they are under no means the ultimatum for how roofs should be depicted in other programs. For example: `roof:shape=sawtooth` and `roof:shape=onion`, as these both would be up to the developer to decide how these would be displayed on various building sizes.

I created the first batch of icons in 2021 for the OpenStreetMap Wiki. Later in 2024 I redesigned the render to be isometric along with improved contrast and colors.
